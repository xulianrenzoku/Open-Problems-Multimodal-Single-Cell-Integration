### About the Competition
- **Task:** Predict how DNA, RNA, and protein measurements co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stem cells develop into more mature blood cells. There are two tasks specifically:
  - Multiome: Given **chromatin accessibility (DNA)**, predict **gene expression (RNA)**
    - # of input features: 228,942
    - # of output features: 23,418
  - CITEseq: Given **gene expression (RNA)**, predict **protein levels**
    - # of input features: 23,418
    - # of output features: 140
- **Eval Metric:** According the competition host at Kaggle, they "use the Pearson correlation coefficient to rank submissions".
